# LinkMe LinkedIn Connection Automation Tool

This command-line Python tool automates the process of logging into LinkedIn,
visiting profiles, submitting "Connect", and leaving a friendly message to a list
of LinkedIn profile URLs.

This tool is intended for students and the like who wish to grow their network
from a list of fellow individuals also looking to connect. A text document such as a
Google Docs file can hold the list of LinkedIn profile URLs and is manually downloaded
to the project folder for the script to use. A list of previously visited profiles
is kept and those profiles are skipped so the same source list can be run multiple
times as new names are added.

## Quick Start

1. Install Python.
2. Clone repository.
3. Create a virtual environment and install selenium.
4. Download chromedriver to local project directory for selenium to use.
5. Set CHROME_DRIVER_LOCATION in linkme.py to the relative path to the chromedriver
   file (i.e. chromedriver.exe).
6. Set USERNAME and PASSWORD in linkme.py for your LinkedIn account.
7. Change SCHOOL in linkme.py if appropriate and customize message in helper.py if desired.
8. Manually download a text file of LinkedIn profile URL's and save as students.txt
   inside linkme folder, overwriting any old file. (Clunky but works for now)
9. Run the script: python linkme.py
10. Enjoy your new LinkedIn connections!

### Note on chromedriver:

Go to https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads and download
chromedriver for the version of Chrome you use. Unzip file and place in the linkme
folder. Set CHROME_DRIVER_LOCATION variable in linkme.py to the local path
of the driver file.

For example, leave the driver in the folder it was originally in when unzipped
and set variable:
CHROME_DRIVER_LOCATION = r"chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe".

There may be other ways to install chromedriver globally, but this method works.
